## 1 Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to deploy a **highly available and scalable WordPress website on AWS**. The website will use the following AWS services:  

- **VPC**: To create a secure and isolated network environment.  
- **RDS**: To host the MySQL database for WordPress.  
- **EFS**: To provide shared storage for WordPress files.  
- **ALB (Application Load Balancer)**: To distribute traffic across multiple WordPress instances.  
- **Auto Scaling**: To automatically scale the number of WordPress instances based on traffic.  

---

## 2. Project Objectives  
- **Design and implement** a secure **VPC** with public and private subnets.  
- **Set up** a **MySQL database** using Amazon RDS.  
- **Configure shared file storage** using Amazon **EFS** for WordPress files.  
- **Deploy WordPress** on **EC2 instances** and ensure **high availability** using **ALB and Auto Scaling**.  
- **Test and validate** the setup to ensure **scalability, performance, and security**.  

---

## 3. Project Deliverables  
✔ **Architecture Diagram**: A visual representation of the AWS infrastructure.  
✔ **Step-by-Step Implementation Guide**: Detailed documentation of the setup process.  
✔ **Working WordPress Website**: A fully functional WordPress site hosted on AWS.  
✔ **Testing and Validation Report**: Results of performance, scalability, and security tests.
