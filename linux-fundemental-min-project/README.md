# Mini Project-Linux Fundamental 
This project combines Linux fundamentals with cloud computing by focusing on creating and managing an Amazon EC2 instance. It includes learning essential Linux commands, file system navigation, and shell scripting while also covering how to launch and configure an EC2 instance on AWS. The project guides you through securely connecting to the EC2 instance locally via SSH, setting up permissions, and performing basic administrative tasks. This hands-on approach bridges the gap between Linux skills and cloud environments, providing a solid foundation for system administration and cloud computing.
